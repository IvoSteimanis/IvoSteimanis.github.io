So I was very happy to have the opportunity to do research for my PhD there and for my own, in-depth view on these issues! In mainstream media rising sea-level has become almost synonymous to climate change and global warming. The media is portraying the image of a modern day Atlantis and headlines (see figure below) are pushing the angle towards vanishing islands due to rising sea-levels.\n\r\rCommon news headlines for searching \u0026lsquo;pacific islands +sea level rise\u0026rsquo;\r\r\rThe trigger for most of the above headlines and also a lot of controversy in the scientific community, was the study by Albert et al. from 2016. In this study the authors offer evidence that five Pacific islands were lost to the sea. However, the influence of climate change on these results got exaggerated by the media, as the author himself later admits. In his view, the main take-away message from the study is that \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; these observations from the Solomons are a warning of things to come irrespective of if climate change alone caused it or a range of factors\u0026rdquo;. When reading the article by Albert et al. it becomes clear that these five islands were lost because of a combination of multiple factors; rising sea-level, wave exposure and probably also tectonic activity, and not necessarily attributed to climate change alone. Additionally, it seems that the sampling of islands is rather selective and not representative for Solomon Islands. A recent study by Kench et al (2018, see also by Mann \u0026amp; Westphal, 2014) present findings of shoreline change in all 101 islands of Tuvalu over the past four decades using the same methodology as Albert et al., but undoubtedly a more representative sample. They find that three quarters of Tuvalu\u0026rsquo;s islands have increased in size, yielding a net gain in land mass of over 70 hectare, which is nearly three percent of the total land mass of Tuvalu. Their results challenge the widespread perceptions of island loss and highlight the importance for alternative, local level adaptation strategies that embrace heterogeneity of atoll islands and their dynamics.\nThe exacerbated representation of scientific findings as done in many news articles, might lead to two important problems. Firstly, trust in science could be undermined when readers find out later that the overstated results were not true. Most likely, they will not blame the journalist who wrote about the issue, but rather the author of the research paper and thereby lose faith in science itself. Scientists, especially in a domain with a lot of uncertainty and importance such as the impacts of climate change, should put more effort into carefully communicating their results to the public.\nThe second concern is with the people living on low-lying pacific islands. In times, where internet is available even on the most remote atoll islands, access to online news is widespread. This is one channel people use to get new information about climatic changes in Solomon Islands. People use these information to form their own expectations and perceptions about climate change. Based on my experience from a low-lying atoll formation, Reef Islands, in Solomon Islands, it seems that many people expect the worst-case scenario of inundation in the near future. They often use a \u0026ldquo;victim\u0026rdquo; narrative to explain their dependence on outsiders, such as NGOs, to help them with the consequences of climate change. This is very problematic, as climate change becomes the scapegoat for nearly every problem related to the environment and leads often to inaction. This causes a self-amplifying cycle, where people are unwilling to make investments or take actions and thereby increase their dependence on outsiders. Thus, researchers, journalists and organizations should be careful in the way they craft and communicate messages about climate change. Spreading doomsday scenarios may affect atoll states at a larger scale by increasing dependence on the international community and hindering institutional investments into \u0026ldquo;atoll futures\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is not to say that people should not have access to better information about climate change impacts, however it is important to also deliver positive, empowering messages that encourage investments local level adaptation, continued cooperation and responsible stewardship of natural resources. After all, people have been living on these islands for thousands of years. A sea level rise of a few centimeters is unlikely to make all these islands inhabitable in the near future. However, life on these islands will become more difficult. Even more so if communities do not invest in adaption strategies.\nReferences  Albert S., Leon J. X., Grinham A. R., Church J. A., Gibbes B.

Leaders are responsible for drafting and enforcing rules concerning resource management and may strongly influence behavior of other resource users. The quality of leadership is also crucial for the success of decentralization reforms that have been initiated across the world in the last two decades and that are often accompanied with the creation of elected councils on the lowest level of governance responsible for managing public goods and natural resources. Decentralization and democratization reforms may improve local public good provision, but they are also prone to power abuse, nepotism, arbitrary rule enforcement, and other forms of misbehavior of leaders that may undermine trust and cooperation among community members and impede sustainable resource management.\nThis study provides experimental evidence from 32 communities in Northern Namibia on the nepotistic use of punishment and procedural fairness of local leaders. In the study area, decentralization reforms have created a coexistence of democratically legitimized leaders responsible for water management and traditional authorities, who inherit their position and have the power to allocate land to resource users. In addition, the project investigates whether leadership strategies and leaders’ personality traits have explanatory power for the real-life performance of leaders and whether local villagers’ perceptions about resource availability have an impact on the election of different types of leaders. The results of this project contribute to the broad strands of literature on leadership, decentralization policies and common-pool resource management.\nThe study was carried out in the Ohangwena region in northern Namibia in summer 2014. In this area, the majority of inhabitants, about 80% of participants, are pastoralists who strongly depend on the availability of grazing and water resources. Access to and the management of these resources is regulated both by traditional and democratically elected leaders. The study employed three local research assistants who are native Oukwwanyama, born and raised in the study area, but currently enrolled at the University of Namibia (UNAM) in Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia. We use a combination of lab-in-the field experiments and surveys to answer our research questions:\nIs \u0026lsquo;nepotism\u0026rsquo; more prevalent under democratically legitimized or traditional forms of leadership? Do democratically elected leaders place procedural justice before self-privileges to a larger extent than traditional leaders?\n","date":1573038959,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573038959,"objectID":"6e3092bb88232cbdf47e358ce26768a7","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/project/leadership/","publishdate":"2019-11-06T12:15:59+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/leadership/","section":"project","summary":"Procedural fairness and nepotism among local traditional and democratic leaders in rural Namibia","tags":["Leadership","Traditional authorities","Democratization"],"title":"Local leaders in Namibia","type":"project"},{"authors":["Björn Vollan","Matthias Mayer","Adam Henry","Ivo Steimanis"],"categories":["Project"],"content":"Climate change, migration of human populations, and environmental degradation are interrelated in a complex coupled human and natural system. While people have historically abandoned places with harsh conditions, the scale of these flows is expected to increase dramatically as a result of climate change. Environmental migrants are individuals forced to migrate from their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local environment compromising their well-being or secure livelihood.\nThere is consent among researchers that climate change will result in increasing migration and even the need to resettle entire populations. Many environmental scientists believe that the sea level will rise as a consequence of global warming and the Solomon Islands will be heavily affected by such an occurrence.\nThe “Shadow of the future” project examine, how people are likely to change their behavior in light of future climate changes, and build scenarios about potential responses, but also about their exposure to risk. The research project will identify the human reaction to severe impacts of climate change by combining an original comparative research design and the use of economic experiments, survey methods and modelling techniques. With this combination we aim to analyze how risk perception, preferences and behavior of people change with the prospect of being severely affected by climate change and whether and how the preferences translate into choices for short- and medium adaption strategies. Thus we examine the behavioral motives of potential climate refugees.\nOur comparative design will sample people who have been affected by different degrees of sea level rise on the Solomon Islands. We sample people from low lying atolls, which are at the maximum 2m above the sea level and from higher lying islands, as well as people who already migrated from the atolls.\n","date":1573038398,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573038398,"objectID":"e335eca8f8e7ef622b8ab8a7ffafee41","permalink":"https://ivosteimanis.github.io/project/sotf/","publishdate":"2019-11-06T12:06:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sotf/","section":"project","summary":"The aim of the project is to better understand the climate change migration nexus.

As a response to climate change impacts in island communities, such as sea level rise, discounting the future can be a rational response due to increased stress on natural resources and uncertainty about whether future generations will have the same access to the same resources. By incorporating systematic responses of discount rates into models of resource conservation, realistic expectations of future human responses to climate change and associated resource stress may be developed. This paper illustrates the importance of time discounting through a theoretical agent-based model of resource use in island communities. A discount rate change can dramatically change projections about future migration and community-based conservation efforts. Our simulation results show that an increase in discount rates due to a credible information shock about future climate change impacts is likely to speed resource depletion. The negative impacts of climate change are therefore likely to be underestimated if changes in discount rates and emerging migration patterns are not taken into account.","tags":["ABM","Discounting","Sea-level rise"],"title":"Influence of sea level rise on discounting, resource use and migration in small-island communities: an agent-based modelling approach","type":"publication"}]
